abstract = {Background: Estimating the total fertility rate is challenging for many developing countries because of limited data and varying data quality. A standardized, reproducible approach to produce estimates that include an uncertainty assessment is desired. Methods: We develop a method to estimate and assess uncertainty in the total fertility rate over time, based on multiple imperfect observations from different data sources, including surveys and censuses. We take account of measurement error in observations by decomposing it into bias and variance, and assess both by linear regression on a variety of data quality covariates. We estimate the total fertility rate using a local smoother, and assess uncertainty using the weighted likelihood bootstrap. Results: We apply our method to data from seven countries in West Africa and construct estimates and uncertainty intervals for the total fertility rate. Based on cross-validation exercises, we find that accounting for differences in data quality between observations gives better calibrated confidence intervals and reduces bias. Conclusions: When working with multiple imperfect observations from different data sources to estimate the total fertility rate, or demographic indicators in general, potential biases and differences in error variance should be taken into account to improve the estimates and their uncertainty assessment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Leontine Alkema et al.},

abstract = {We describe a Bayesian projection model to produce country-specific projections of the total fertility rate (TFR) for all countries. The model decomposes the evolution of TFR into three phases: pre-transition high fertility, the fertility transition, and post-transition low fertility. The model for the fertility decline builds on the United Nations Population Division's current deterministic projection methodology, which assumes that fertility will eventually fall below replacement level. It models the decline in TFR as the sum of two logistic functions that depend on the current TFR level, and a random term. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to project future TFR based on both the country's TFR history and the pattern of all countries. It is estimated from United Nations estimates of past TFR in all countries using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The post-transition low fertility phase is modeled using an autoregressive model, in which long-term TFR projections converge toward and oscillate around replacement level. The method is evaluated using out-of-sample projections for the period since 1980 and the period since 1995, and is found to be well calibrated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Population Association of America.},

We develop EB methods that treat schedules as vectors and use adaptive neighborhoods to keep estimates appropriately local. This method estimates demographic rates for local subpopulations by borrowing strength not only from similar individuals elsewhere but also from other groups in the same area and from regularities in schedules across locations.

abstract = {Forecasts of completed fertility predict how many children will be born on average by women over their entire reproductive lifetime. These forecasts are important in informing public policy and influencing additional research in the social sciences. However, nothing is known about how to choose a forecasting method from a large basket of variants. We identified 20 major methods, with 162 variants altogether. The approaches range from naive freezing of current age-specific fertility rates to methods that use statistically sophisticated techniques or are grounded in demographic theory. We assess each method by evaluating the overall accuracy and if provided, uncertainty estimates using fertility data of all available birth cohorts and countries of the Human Fertility Database, which covers 1,096 birth cohorts from 29 countries. Across multiple measures of forecast accuracy, we find only four methods that consistently outperform the naive freeze rates method, and only two methods produce uncertainty estimates that are not severely downward biased. Among the top four, there are two simple extrapolation methods and two Bayesian methods. The latter are demanding in terms of input data, statistical techniques, and computational power but do not consistently complete cohort fertility more accurately at all truncation ages than simple extrapolation. This broad picture is unchanged if we base the validation on 201 United Nations countries and six world regions, including Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, northern America, and Oceania.},

abstract = {In countries without reliable vital registration systems – the majority of low- and middle-income countries – most vital statistical estimates are based on nationally representative household survey data.  Such surveys are usually implemented under the USAID-funded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) project.  Because DHS data are so widely used, the quality of these data is paramount to enable countries to monitor their population growth and health and track progress towards international development goals.  This dissertation aims to provide a careful, detailed interrogation of DHS data quality in the areas of fertility, child mortality, and contraceptive use.The first chapter examines linkages between questionnaire length and data quality. I analyze 238 DHS Surveys to ascertain whether changes in the DHS survey instrument – predominantly increases in length and complexity of the core questionnaire over time – have led to poorer data quality and thus biased fertility and child mortality rates.  I explain the likely causes and consequences of one measure of data quality: birth displacement, disaggregated by child survival status.  I examine differences in displacement by DHS survey characteristics, including the average number of non-missing variables per woman interviewed in each survey (a proxy measure of questionnaire length) and modules including HIV biomarker testing. Results indicate substantial birth displacement in the majority of DHS surveys, and disproportionate displacement of dead children compared to surviving children. Increases in birth displacement, and differential displacement of deceased children, are associated with increases in questionnaire length. This differential displacement likely biases recent estimates of infant and under-five mortality rates downward which in turn overestimates recent declines in these indicators.The second chapter focuses on the quality data acquired through one section of the DHS questionnaire: the reproductive calendar, in which women are asked to recall their births, pregnancies, terminations, and episodes of contraceptive use for the last 5-7 years. I compare retrospective contraceptive prevalence rates (CPR) tabulated from the calendar to independently estimated current status CPR from a prior survey for the same point in time among women in the same age groups. The chapter compares estimates of the total CPR as well as the prevalence of each specific contraceptive method for 106 pairs of surveys conducted in 37 countries. I find that calendar data appear to underestimate contraceptive use in most comparisons, often substantially. Total contraceptive prevalence is reported at statistically significantly different levels in 74 percent of survey pairs analyzed. The average difference in CPR was 4.1 percentage points, resulting in an average discrepancy of 15 percent between the current use CPR and that estimated from retrospective calendar data for the same point in time. The third chapter builds on the findings from Chapter 2, using the comparisons between retrospective calendar data and current status data and other data quality indicators, to select 16 surveys in which reproductive calendar data appear to be reliable.  Contraceptive use data from these 16 countries were pooled together for a sample of 140,529 episodes of contraceptive use collected from 97,094 women's reproductive histories.  I use this pooled dataset to estimate cumulative 12-month contraceptive failure rates for each of the most widely-used contraceptive methods. Correlates of contraceptive failure are examined using multilevel survival models. I find that contraceptive failure rates are generally higher when calculated from surveys with reliable data compared to median estimates across all DHS surveys, suggesting that surveys with unreliable calendars underestimate contraceptive failure rates. Contraceptive failure rates vary widely by age, with adolescent women experiencing the highest failure rates.  Failure also appears associated with socio-economic status, suggesting that the youngest and poorest women are at highest risk of experiencing unintended pregnancy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) is an important metric of child health and survival. Country-level estimates of U5MR are readily available, but efforts to estimate U5MR subnationally have been limited, in part, due to spatial misalignment of available data sources (e.g., use of different administrative levels, or as a result of historical boundary changes). METHODS We analyzed all available complete and summary birth history data in surveys and censuses in six countries (Bangladesh, Cameroon, Chad, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia) at the finest geographic level available in each data source. We then developed small area estimation models capable of incorporating spatially misaligned data. These small area estimation models were applied to the birth history data in order to estimate trends in U5MR from 1980 to 2015 at the second administrative level in Cameroon, Chad, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia and at the third administrative level in Bangladesh. RESULTS We found substantial variation in U5MR in all six countries: there was more than a two-fold difference in U5MR between the area with the highest rate and the area with the lowest rate in every country. All areas in all countries experienced declines in U5MR between 1980 and 2015, but the degree varied both within and between countries. In Cameroon, Chad, Mozambique, and Zambia we found areas with U5MRs in 2015 that were higher than in other parts of the same country in 1980. Comparing subnational U5MR to country-level targets for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), we find that 12.8{\%} of areas in Bangladesh did not meet the country-level target, although the country as whole did. A minority of areas in Chad, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia met the country-level MDG targets while these countries as a whole did not. CONCLUSIONS Subnational estimates of U5MR reveal significant within-country variation. These estimates could be used for identifying high-need areas and positive deviants, tracking trends in geographic inequalities, and evaluating progress towards international development targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes a unified framework for a Bayesian analysis of incidence or mortality data in space and time. We introduce four different types of prior distributions for space?time interaction in extension of a model with only main effects. Each type implies a certain degree of prior dependence for the interaction parameters, and corresponds to the product of one of the two spatial with one of the two temporal main effects. The methodology is illustrated by an analysis of Ohio lung cancer data 1968?1988 via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. We compare the fit and the complexity of several models with different types of interaction by means of quantities related to the posterior deviance. Our results confirm an epidemiological hypothesis about the temporal development of the association between urbanization and risk factors for cancer. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

abstract = {Background: Global monitoring efforts have relied on national estimates of modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) for many low-income countries. However, most contraceptive delivery programs are implemented by health departments at lower administrative levels, reflecting a persisting gap between the availability of and need for subnational mCPR estimates. Methods: Using woman-level data from multiple semi-annual national survey rounds conducted between 2013 and 2016 in five sub-Saharan African countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda) by the Performance, Monitoring and Accountability 2020 project, we propose a Bayesian Hierarchical Model with a standard set of covariates and temporally correlated random effects to estimate the level and trend of mCPR for first level administrative divisions in each country. Results: There is considerable narrowing of the uncertainty interval (UI) around the model-based estimates, compared to the estimates directly based on the survey data. We find substantial variations in the estimated subnational mCPRs. Uganda, for example, shows a gain in mCPR of 6.4{\%} (95{\%} UI: 4.5-8.3) based on model estimates of 20.9{\%} (19.6-22.2) in mid-2014 and 27.3{\%} (26.0-28.8) in mid-2016, with change across 10 regions ranging from - 0.6 points in Karamoja to 9.4 points in Central 2 region. The lower bound of the UIs of the change over four rounds was above 0 in 6 regions. Similar upward trends are observed for most regions in the other four countries, and there is noticeable within-country geographic variation. Conclusions: Reliable subnational estimates of mCPR empower health departments in evidence-based policy making. Despite nationally increasing mCPRs, regional disparities exist within countries suggesting uneven contraceptive access. Raising investments in disadvantaged areas may be warranted to increase equity in access to modern contraceptive methods.},

abstract = {The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is a critical and widely available population health indicator. Both the MDGs and SDGs define targets for improvement in the U5MR, and the SDGs require spatial disaggregation of indicators. We estimate trends in the U5MR for Admin-1 subnational areas using 122 DHS surveys in 35 countries in Africa and assess progress toward the MDG target reductions for each subnational region and each country as a whole. In each country, direct weighted estimates of the U5MR from each survey are calculated and combined into a single estimate for each Admin-1 region across five-year periods. Our method fully accounts for the sample design of each survey. The region-time-specific estimates are smoothed using a Bayesian, space-time model that produces more precise estimates (when compared to the direct estimates) at a one-year scale that are consistent with each other in both space and time. The resulting estimated distributions of the U5MR are summarized and used to assess subnational progress toward the MDG 4 target of two-thirds reduction in the U5MR during 1990-2015. Our space-time modeling approach is tractable and can be readily applied to a large collection of sample survey data. Subnational, regional spatial heterogeneity in the levels and trends in the U5MR vary considerably across Africa. There is no generalizable pattern between spatial heterogeneity and levels or trends in the U5MR. Subnational, small-area estimates of the U5MR: (i) identify subnational regions where interventions are still necessary and those where improvement is well under way; and (ii) countries where there is very little spatial variation and others where there are important differences between subregions in both levels and trends. More work is necessary to improve both the data sources and methods necessary to adequately measure subnational progress toward the SDG child survival targets.},

abstract = {Background: Ambitious global goals have been established to provide universal access to affordable modern contraceptive methods. To measure progress toward such goals in populous countries like Nigeria, it's essential to characterize the current levels and trends of family planning (FP) indicators such as unmet need and modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR). Moreover, the substantial heterogeneity across Nigeria and scale of programmatic implementation requires a sub-national resolution of these FP indicators. The aim of this study is to estimate the levels and trends of FP indicators at a subnational scale in Nigeria utilizing all available data and accounting for survey design and uncertainty. Methods: We utilized all available cross-sectional survey data from Nigeria including the Demographic and Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, National Nutrition and Health Surveys, and Performance, Monitoring, and Accountability 2020. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates all of the individual level data from each survey instrument, accounts for survey uncertainty, leverages spatiooral smoothing, and produces probabilistic estimates with uncertainty intervals. Results: We estimate that overall rates and trends of mCPR and unmet need have remained low in Nigeria: The average annual rate of change for mCPR by state is 0.5{\%} (0.4{\%},0.6{\%}) from 2012-2017. Unmet need by age-parity demographic groups varied significantly across Nigeria; parous women express much higher rates of unmet need than nulliparous women. Conclusions: Understanding the estimates and trends of FP indicators at a subnational resolution in Nigeria is integral to inform programmatic decision-making. We identify age-parity-state subgroups with large rates of unmet need. We also find conflicting trends by survey instrument across a number of states. Our model-based estimates highlight these inconsistencies, attempt to reconcile the direct survey estimates, and provide uncertainty intervals to enable interpretation of model and survey estimates for decision-making.},

abstract = {Background: Population estimates underpin demographic and epidemiological research and are used to track progress on numerous international indicators of health and development. To date, internationally available estimates of population and fertility, although useful, have not been produced with transparent and replicable methods and do not use standardised estimates of mortality. We present single-calendar year and single-year of age estimates of fertility and population by sex with standardised and replicable methods. Methods: We estimated population in 195 locations by single year of age and single calendar year from 1950 to 2017 with standardised and replicable methods. We based the estimates on the demographic balancing equation, with inputs of fertility, mortality, population, and migration data. Fertility data came from 7817 location-years of vital registration data, 429 surveys reporting complete birth histories, and 977 surveys and censuses reporting summary birth histories. We estimated age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs; the annual number of livebirths to women of a specified age group per 1000 women in that age group) by use of spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and used the ASFRs to estimate total fertility rates (TFRs; the average number of children a woman would bear if she survived through the end of the reproductive age span [age 10–54 years] and experienced at each age a particular set of ASFRs observed in the year of interest). Because of sparse data, fertility at ages 10–14 years and 50–54 years was estimated from data on fertility in women aged 15–19 years and 45–49 years, through use of linear regression. Age-specific mortality data came from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 estimates. Data on population came from 1257 censuses and 761 population registry location-years and were adjusted for underenumeration and age misreporting with standard demographic methods. Migration was estimated with the GBD Bayesian demographic balancing model, after incorporating information about refugee migration into the model prior. Final population estimates used the cohort-component method of population projection, with inputs of fertility, mortality, and migration data. Population uncertainty was estimated by use of out-of-sample predictive validity testing. With these data, we estimated the trends in population by age and sex and in fertility by age between 1950 and 2017 in 195 countries and territories. Findings: From 1950 to 2017, TFRs decreased by 49{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 46{\textperiodcentered}4–52{\textperiodcentered}0). The TFR decreased from 4{\textperiodcentered}7 livebirths (4{\textperiodcentered}5–4{\textperiodcentered}9) to 2{\textperiodcentered}4 livebirths (2{\textperiodcentered}2–2{\textperiodcentered}5), and the ASFR of mothers aged 10–19 years decreased from 37 livebirths (34–40) to 22 livebirths (19–24) per 1000 women. Despite reductions in the TFR, the global population has been increasing by an average of 83{\textperiodcentered}8 million people per year since 1985. The global population increased by 197{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (193{\textperiodcentered}3–200{\textperiodcentered}8) since 1950, from 2{\textperiodcentered}6 billion (2{\textperiodcentered}5–2{\textperiodcentered}6) to 7{\textperiodcentered}6 billion (7{\textperiodcentered}4–7{\textperiodcentered}9) people in 2017; much of this increase was in the proportion of the global population in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The global annual rate of population growth increased between 1950 and 1964, when it peaked at 2{\textperiodcentered}0{\%}; this rate then remained nearly constant until 1970 and then decreased to 1{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} in 2017. Population growth rates in the southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania GBD super-region decreased from 2{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} in 1963 to 0{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} in 2017, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa, population growth rates were almost at the highest reported levels ever in 2017, when they were at 2{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}. The global average age increased from 26{\textperiodcentered}6 years in 1950 to 32{\textperiodcentered}1 years in 2017, and the proportion of the population that is of working age (age 15–64 years) increased from 59{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} to 65{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}. At the national level, the TFR decreased in all countries and territories between 1950 and 2017; in 2017, TFRs ranged from a low of 1{\textperiodcentered}0 livebirths (95{\%} UI 0{\textperiodcentered}9–1{\textperiodcentered}2) in Cyprus to a high of 7{\textperiodcentered}1 livebirths (6{\textperiodcentered}8–7{\textperiodcentered}4) in Niger. The TFR under age 25 years (TFU25; number of livebirths expected by age 25 years for a hypothetical woman who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs) in 2017 ranged from 0{\textperiodcentered}08 livebirths (0{\textperiodcentered}07–0{\textperiodcentered}09) in South Korea to 2{\textperiodcentered}4 livebirths (2{\textperiodcentered}2–2{\textperiodcentered}6) in Niger, and the TFR over age 30 years (TFO30; number of livebirths expected for a hypothetical woman ageing from 30 to 54 years who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs) ranged from a low of 0{\textperiodcentered}3 livebirths (0{\textperiodcentered}3–0{\textperiodcentered}4) in Puerto Rico to a high of 3{\textperiodcentered}1 livebirths (3{\textperiodcentered}0–3{\textperiodcentered}2) in Niger. TFO30 was higher than TFU25 in 145 countries and territories in 2017. 33 countries had a negative population growth rate from 2010 to 2017, most of which were located in central, eastern, and western Europe, whereas population growth rates of more than 2{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} were seen in 33 of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, less than 65{\%} of the national population was of working age in 12 of 34 high-income countries, and less than 50{\%} of the national population was of working age in Mali, Chad, and Niger. Interpretation: Population trends create demographic dividends and headwinds (ie, economic benefits and detriments) that affect national economies and determine national planning needs. Although TFRs are decreasing, the global population continues to grow as mortality declines, with diverse patterns at the national level and across age groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide transparent and replicable estimates of population and fertility, which can be used to inform decision making and to monitor progress.

abstract = {In recent years, disease mapping studies have become a routine application within geographical epidemiology and are typically analysed within a Bayesian hierarchical model formulation. A variety of model formulations for the latent level have been proposed but all come with inherent issues. In the classical BYM (Besag, York and Molli{\'{e}}) model, the spatially structured component cannot be seen independently from the unstructured component. This makes prior definitions for the hyperparameters of the two random effects challenging. There are alternative model formulations that address this confounding; however, the issue on how to choose interpretable hyperpriors is still unsolved. Here, we discuss a recently proposed parameterisation of the BYM model that leads to improved parameter control as the hyperparameters can be seen independently from each other. Furthermore, the need for a scaled spatial component is addressed, which facilitates assignment of interpretable hyperpriors and make these transferable between spatial applications with different graph structures. The hyperparameters themselves are used to define flexible extensions of simple base models. Consequently, penalised complexity priors for these parameters can be derived based on the information-theoretic distance from the flexible model to the base model, giving priors with clear interpretation. We provide implementation details for the new model formulation which preserve sparsity properties, and we investigate systematically the model performance and compare it to existing parameterisations. Through a simulation study, we show that the new model performs well, both showing good learning abilities and good shrinkage behaviour. In terms of model choice criteria, the proposed model performs at least equally well as existing parameterisations, but only the new formulation offers parameters that are interpretable and hyperpriors that have a clear meaning.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of the under-five mortality rate in a developing world context are a key barometer of the health of a nation. This paper describes a new model to analyze survey data on mortality in this context. We are interested in both spatial and temporal description, that is wishing to estimate under-five mortality rate across regions and years and to investigate the association between the under-five mortality rate and spatially varying covariate surfaces. We illustrate the methodology by producing yearly estimates for subnational areas in Kenya over the period 1980–2014 using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, which use stratified cluster sampling. We use a binomial likelihood with fixed effects for the urban/rural strata and random effects for the clustering to account for the complex survey design. Smoothing is carried out using Bayesian hierarchical models with continuous spatial and temporally discrete components. A key component of the model is an offset to adjust for bias due to the effects of HIV epidemics. Substantively, there has been a sharp decline in Kenya in the under-five mortality rate in the period 1980–2014, but large variability in estimated subnational rates remains. A priority for future research is understanding this variability. In exploratory work, we examine whether a variety of spatial covariate surfaces can explain the variability in under-five mortality rate. Temperature, precipitation, a measure of malaria infection prevalence, and a measure of nearness to cities were candidates for inclusion in the covariate model, but the interplay between space, time, and covariates is complex.},

abstract = {Since 1985, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has conducted more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries. These surveys provide decision markers with key measures of population demographics, health and nutrition, which allow informed policy evaluation to be made. Though standard health indicators are routinely published in survey final reports, much of the value of DHS is derived from the ability to download and analyse standardised microdata datasets for subgroup analysis, pooled multi-country analysis, and extended research studies. We have developed an open-source freely available R package ‘rdhs' to facilitate management and processing of DHS survey data. The package provides a suite of tools to (1) access standard survey indicators through the DHS Program API, (2) identify all survey datasets that include a particular topic or indicator relevant to a particular analysis, (3) directly download survey datasets from the DHS website, (4) load datasets and data dictionaries into R, and (5) extract variables and pool harmonised datasets for multi-survey analysis. We detail the core functionality of ‘rdhs' by demonstrating how the package can be used to firstly compare trends in the prevalence of anaemia among women between countries before conducting secondary analysis to assess for the relationship between education and anemia.},
